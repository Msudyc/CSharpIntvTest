/*
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of 
the longest consecutive elements sequence. 

For example,
 Given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2],
 The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. 
 Return its length: 4. 

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity. 

class Solution {
public:
    int longestConsecutive(List<int> &num) {
        
    }
};

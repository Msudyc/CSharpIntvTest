/*
Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such 
that the sum is closest to a given number, target. Return the 
sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would 
have exactly one solution.

    For example, given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1.

    The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).

class Solution {
public:
    int threeSumClosest(List<int> &num, int target) {
        
    }
};

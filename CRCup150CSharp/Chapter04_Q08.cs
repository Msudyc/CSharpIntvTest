/* Question 4.8
 
You have two very large binary trees: T1, with millions of nodes, and T2, with hundreds of nodes.
Create an algorithm to decide if T2 is a subtree of T1.
A tree T2 is a subtree of T1 if there exists a node n in T1 such that the subtree of n is identical 
to T2. That is, if you cut off the tree at node n, the two trees would be identical.

/* Question 5.8
 
A monochrome screen is stored as a single array of bytes, allowing eight consecutive pixels 
to be stored in one byte. The screen has width w, where w is divisible by 8 (that is, no 
byte will be split across rows). The height of he screen, of course, can be derived from 
the length of the array and the width. Implement a function 
drawHorizontalLine(byte[] screen, int width, int x1, int x2, int y)
which draws a horizontal line from (x1, y) to (x2, y).

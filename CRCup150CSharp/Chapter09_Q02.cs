/* Question 9.2
 
Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left corner of an X by Y grid. The robot can only 
move in two directions: right and down. How many possible paths are there for the robot
to go fom (0,0) to (X,Y)?
Follow up:
Imagine certain spots are "off limits," such that the robot cannot step on them. Design 
an algorithm to find a path for the robot from the top left to the bottom right.

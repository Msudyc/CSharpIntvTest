/* Question 5.7
 
An array A contains all the integers from 0 to n, except from one number which is missing. 
In this problem, we cannot access an entire integer in A with a single operation. The 
elements of A are represented in binary, and the only operation we can use to access them
is "fetch the jth bit of A[i]," which takes constant time. Write code to find the missing 
integer. Can you do it in O(n) time?

/* Question 11.3
 
Given a sorted array of n integers that has been rotated an unknown number of times, 
write code to find an element in the array. You may assume that the array was originally
sorted in increasing order. 
Sample;
Input: find 5 in {15, 16, 19, 20, 25, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14}
Output: 8 (the index of 5 in the array)
